# Asteroids_game, project made following BootDev course of the same name - project is incomplete and not functional

# This game uses the pygame library, it will not work without it
# At the time of writing, the version imported is 2.6.0 (as noted in requirements.txt), which imports pip ver 24.3.1 alongside
# 'pip show pygame' is used to determine current version and 'pip install -r requirements.txt' is used to install pygame, using requirements.txt for the version
# Pygame will likely recieved updates in the future however and this code is simple enough that it should remain compatible for a long period of time, but check backwards compatability

# Additionally, it uses virtual environment venv which comes with python and you must activate the environment before running the game
# Activating the venv is done with this code in the terminal: source venv/bin/activate
# Should other virtual environments be available in the future it should still work, but do check backwards compatability
